Adding a table of contents becomes very easy with Daux.io

## Automatic

A table of contents can be added automatically to all pages.

If `[TOC]` isn't present it will add it at the beginning of the page.

You can enable this feature in your configuration

```json
{
	"auto_toc": true
}
```

## Manual

Add `[TOC]` anywhere in your document and it will be replaced by a table of contents
